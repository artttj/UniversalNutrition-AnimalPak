# SomethingDigital_MigrationBryantPark

## Purpose

This module utilizes `SomethingDigital_Migration` to allow for migrating theme-specific content between environments. For example, categories, CMS content like BlueFoot pages & static blocks, store configuration settings, etc.

Only migrations related to the BryantPark theme should be placed here. We also have modules for SomethingDigital_MigrationAccelerator & Somethingdigital_MigrationProject (general module for the actual build) which can be used for related migrations.

For usage instructions, checkout the main [SomethingDigital_Migration readme](https://github.com/sdinteractive/Magento2_SomethingDigital_Migration/blob/master/README.md).
