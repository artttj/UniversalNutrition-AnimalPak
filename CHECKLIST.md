# New Project Checklist

## Repo

1. Create an empty new GitHub repo (follow naming convention.)
2. Locally, clone the SD Accelerator Package.
3. `git remote rm origin && git remote add origin <NEWREPOURL>`
4. Make sure to push only master and develop to the new repo.

Now you have a new repo.

## TODO

 * Files that need to be changed.
 * Simple things that must be added.
 * CW # in .github/.
